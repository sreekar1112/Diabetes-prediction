# Diabetes Prediction using SVC (Machine Learning Project)

This project predicts whether a patient is diabetic based on medical features using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC). The model is trained on the Pima Indian Diabetes Database, a widely used dataset in healthcare machine learning.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset (Kaggle / UCI Repository)
- Each row represents a patient
- Target column: `Outcome` (1 = diabetic, 0 = not diabetic)

---

##  Features Used
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Pregnancies | Number of times pregnant |
| Glucose | Blood glucose level |
| BloodPressure | Diastolic blood pressure |
| SkinThickness | Skin fold thickness |
| Insulin | Insulin level |
| BMI | Body mass index |
| DiabetesPedigreeFunction | Likelihood of diabetes based on family history |
| Age | Patient age |

---

##  Model Used
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
- Data split into **Training (80%)** and **Testing (20%)**
- Model evaluated using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report

---

##  Results
- SVC model correctly predicts diabetic and non-diabetic patients with good accuracy  
- Shows real-world application of machine learning in medical diagnosis
